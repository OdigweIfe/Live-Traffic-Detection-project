CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Background of the Study
Traffic Violations have been a major concern in modern urban environments, contributing significantly to road accidents, congestion and inefficient traffic management. These violations such as speeding, running red lights, illegal lane changes, unauthorized parking and reckless driving pose risks to both pedestrians and motorists. Traditional traffic enforcement methods, which rely heavily on manual monitoring and on-site police presence, are often inefficient, prone to human error, and difficult to scale in densely populated cities. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras and advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly computer vision, there is growing interest in automating traffic monitoring and violation detection. Computer vision, a field of AI that enables machines to interpret and process visual information, has shown significant promise in various applications including facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous driving. In the context of traffic management, computer vision techniques can analyze CCTV footage to identify vehicles, track their movement, and detect specific violations such as red-light running, illegal lane changes, speeding, and helmet or seatbelt non-compliance [1], [2].
This project aims to develop a basic traffic violation detection system that utilizes CCTV video and computer vision techniques. It focuses on detecting simple violation like running a red light by processing sample video footage, identifying vehicles and traffic signals, and triggering a response when a violation occurs. By automating this process, traffic monitoring becomes more scalable, consistent and efficient. 
1.2 Statement of Problem
Despite the availability of CCTV infrastructure in many urban environments, the detection and enforcement of traffic violations remain largely manual and reactive. Traffic officers often have to review video footage after incidents occur, resulting in delayed responses and missed violations. This manual approach is both labor-intensive and prone to human error, especially in high-traffic zones where violations happen frequently. Additionally, most existing systems lack real-time capabilities to automatically detect specific traffic offenses like red-light running or crossing the stop line. Without automated assistance, law enforcement is limited in its ability to monitor all intersections effectively, especially outside of peak hours or during low visibility conditions.
This project addresses the need for a real-time, automated traffic violation detection system that can process CCTV video using computer vision algorithms, detect key violations, and log them for review and enforcement â€” minimizing human workload and increasing enforcement accuracy [3].
1.3 Aims and  Specific Objectives 
1.3.1 AIM
To develop and implement an automated-intelligent traffic violation detection system which leverages on the use of CCTV footage and computer vision techniques to improve road safety, implement traffic laws and reduce the concern on manual traffic surveillance.
1.3.2 OBJECTIVES 
I. To design a computer vision-based system that is capable of analyzing real-time CCTV footage to detect traffic violations.
II. To implement deep learning models for object detection /classification of vehicles in traffic scenarios.
III. To evaluate system performance under various conditions like heavy traffic, lighting and weather etc. 
1.4 Methodology Overview
The AI-based traffic violation detection system would follow a modular, data driven approach that would integrate computer vision and deep learning techniques for real-time monitoring and enforcement. This also includes data collections which include CCTV footage collected from urban intersections and highways, there are also data sets that include traffic scenarios, weather conditions and common traffic violations.
The development process would include deep learning models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv8 which can be used to detect vehicles, motorcyclists. Custom algorithms are also developed to define and detect violations. We will also use an ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) model to extract the license plate information from detected vehicles using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools. There will also be violation reporting logs that documents the time and date, location, vehicle type and license plate etc. 
1.5 Scope of the Study
The goal of this project is to create an AI-based traffic violation detection system that leverages the use of CCTV footage and computer vision to detect traffic violations with the use of CCTV infrastructure. The scope is restricted due to privacy concerns of ethics and legal.  While it focuses on core detection and reporting functionalities, it leaves out peripheral aspects such as fine management, hardware setup, and law enforcement integration, making it suitable for academic, prototype, or pilot implementations. 
1.6  Significance Of Study
The AI-Based Traffic Violation Detection System using CCTV and Computer Vision plays a vital role in modernizing urban traffic management and ensuring road safety. This study holds significant relevance for both societal and technological advancement, and its implications can be broken down into several key areas like traditional traffic monitoring which relies heavily on manual observation, which is prone to human error and inconsistency. By automating violation detection, the system ensures: Consistent enforcement of traffic rules, Reduction in corruption or bias etc. This study also demonstrates how artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision can be trained to interpret video footage, detect behaviors like red-light jumping, lane violations, or over-speeding, and make autonomous decisions about issuing warnings or penalties.
This toolâ€™s importance through the provision of a few resources can help instill law-abiding behavior in citizens and civic responsibility. When drivers know they are constantly being watched and penalized for violationsâ€”even without physical traffic officersâ€”they are more likely to comply with traffic rules. This contributes to building a more disciplined and responsible driving culture over time.

The review also discusses the challenges related to data quality, environmental conditions, and system deployment, providing a comprehensive foundation for developing robust AI-driven traffic violation solutions.
2.1.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM 
AREA
The historical background of AI-Based Traffic Violation Detection Systems using CCTV and Computer Vision traces the evolution from traditional manual and sensor-based traffic violation detection to the integration of advanced AI and computer vision technologies for enhanced automation, accuracy, and real-time performance.
Initially, traffic violation detection was largely dependent on manual surveillance and basic speed detectors or sensor-based systems, which were limited in coverage, accuracy, and operational efficiency. Before the rise of AI, automated detection relied on deterministic computer vision techniques such as background segmentation and feature extraction to identify specific violations like signal jumping at intersections. These early methods faced challenges related to complexity, environmental variations, and limited types of violations detected.
The breakthrough came with the advent of AI and machine learning, especially deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which revolutionized traffic monitoring by enabling more robust vehicle detection, tracking, and violation recognition. Computer vision frameworks, including OpenCV and deep learning-based detectors such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN, became prevalent for real-time object detection in CCTV footage. The integration of AI models with CCTV systems unlocked continuous, automated surveillance that surpasses human capabilities by reducing bias and errors, allowing 24/7 operation, and handling multiple incidents simultaneously. These AI-driven systems enable real-time detection of violations such as red-light running, illegal overtaking, and speeding with improved accuracy even under challenging conditions like low light or crowded traffic.
Continued research and development have expanded AI applications to include smart city integrations, adaptive traffic signal control, automated challan issuance, and enhanced traffic data analytics. However, despite these advancements, challenges persist in achieving high accuracy in congested environments, expanding the range of detectable violations, reducing computational requirements for real-time deployment, and lowering implementation costs for wider adoption.
This historical progression underscores a shift from manual and rudimentary automated systems to sophisticated AI-based frameworks leveraging CCTV and computer vision, positioning these technologies as critical to future intelligent traffic enforcement and management.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
2.2 TRAFFIC VIOLATION DETECTION SYSTEMS
Traffic violation detection involves identifying and recording breaches of traffic rules, such as speeding, red-light jumping, illegal turns, and lane violations. Traditional detection methods have primarily relied on manual surveillance and fixed devices like speed cameras and induction loop detectors. Despite their usefulness, these systems have drawbacks such as ineffectiveness brought on by human monitoring mistake, limited coverage areas, and slow enforcement response times.  These difficulties emphasize the need for detection solutions that are accurate, scalable, and automated.

Critical Commentary and Relevance
This study is particularly relevant to projects on traffic violation detection using computer vision because it demonstrates how AI-based monitoring can be adapted to complex, real-world traffic environments like those in India.
Its emphasis on cost-effectiveness, adaptability, and real-time alerts makes it a practical blueprint for countries with large, heterogeneous traffic systems. For your project, this highlights the importance of designing systems that are not only technically sound but also context-aware, scalable, and affordable for deployment.
2.7.6 Advanced Computer Vision for Extracting Georeferenced Vehicle Trajectories from Drone Imagery
Traditional traffic monitoring relies on methods such as loop detectors, stationary cameras, and GNSS-based systems. While useful, these approaches face limitations in terms of coverage, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness. Ground-based sensors often create blind spots, stationary cameras have high installation costs with limited fields of view, and GNSS data lacks the precision and flexibility needed for dense urban networks.
With the rise of smart cities, there is a pressing demand for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective solutions that can capture large-scale traffic dynamics. Drones (UAVs), integrated with advanced computer vision (CV) techniques, offer a new way to observe traffic from a birdâ€™s-eye view, enabling detailed extraction of vehicle trajectories and enhancing understanding of complex mobility patterns.
This study addresses the challenge by introducing a comprehensive framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, with applications in traffic monitoring, network modeling, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

2.7.7 Classification of Traffic Violations Using the NaÃ¯ve Bayes Algorithm at Padang City Police
Traffic violations are a growing problem in Padang City, Indonesia. From 2018 to 2023, the Padang City Police recorded 128,913 cases, reflecting a trend that threatens both road safety and law enforcement efficiency. Traditional methods of handling these cases â€” manual review and conventional statistics â€” cannot fully capture hidden patterns in such large datasets.
To address this, the study explores the use of machine learning (ML) for traffic violation classification. The NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) algorithm was chosen because of its effectiveness with large-scale categorical data, low computational requirements, and strong classification ability. The research aims to evaluate NaÃ¯ve Bayes in classifying violations, compare its accuracy under different training/testing ratios, and determine its suitability as a decision-support tool for the police. Gerryliyus Febrera, Jarot Prianggono [7]
2.7.7.1 METHODOLOGY
The research followed a quantitative, experimental approach:
Data Sources
Traffic Ticket Documentation: Official violation records collected by Padang City Police (2018â€“2023), with more than 100,000 entries.
Questionnaires: Distributed to traffic officers to provide additional context.
Algorithm Applied
NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier was used to categorize violation types.
Datasets were split into different training and testing ratios (70:30, 80:20, 90:10) to evaluate consistency.
Performance was further validated through cross-validation tests.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy was the primary performance measure.
Comparisons were made across dataset splits and validation methods.
2.7.7.2 RESULTS AND FINDINGS
High Accuracy:
NaÃ¯ve Bayes achieved 100% accuracy when trained and tested on all dataset ratios (70:30, 80:20, 90:10).
Under cross-validation, the algorithm maintained its highest accuracy at 80:20 and 90:10 ratios.
Dataset Size Influence:
The large dataset (>100,000 entries) strengthened the performance of NaÃ¯ve Bayes.
Smaller splits or imbalanced data would likely reduce accuracy, but in this case, the dataset scale improved robustness.
Algorithm Suitability:
NB demonstrated efficiency in classification, making it feasible for real-world traffic violation monitoring.
Accuracy levels suggest that NB could be integrated into decision-support systems for law enforcement.
2.7.7.2 CONCLUSION
The research demonstrates that the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm is highly effective for classifying traffic violations, achieving near-perfect accuracy with large datasets. Key conclusions include:
NB is well-suited for large-scale categorical datasets, such as police ticket records.
With proper dataset ratio (80:20 or 90:10), it maintains consistent performance.
The approach provides a scalable, low-cost, and accurate method for traffic violation classification in law enforcement systems.
Future Work:The authors suggest exploring other algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for comparison and applying the system in real-time traffic monitoring environments.
Critical Commentary and Relevance
This study is highly relevant to smart traffic violation detection systems. Its findings highlight that machine learning can replace manual case review, saving time and improving accuracy in enforcement. The use of NaÃ¯ve Bayes as a lightweight, efficient classifier is practical for regions with limited computational resources.
For your project, this research underscores the value of classification models in organizing traffic violation data, which can later be integrated with computer vision-based detection systems. It bridges the gap between raw violation detection (via CCTV or sensors) and decision-making support for authorities.
2.7.8 An Improved Object Detection and Trajectory Prediction Method for Traffic Conflicts Analysis
Urbanization and economic growth in Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok have intensified traffic congestion and accident risks. While computer vision has been widely applied in traffic monitoring, there remains a gap in predicting near-miss eventsâ€”critical incidents where accidents are narrowly avoided.
Conventional object detection algorithms struggle with small targets such as motorcycles, bicycles, and e-bikes, which are often at higher risk of fatal collisions. This limitation weakens proactive traffic safety measures like Swedenâ€™s â€œVision Zeroâ€ initiative, which aims to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries to zero.
The authors propose an improved object detection and trajectory prediction method designed to better detect small road users and evaluate near-miss events, contributing to safer urban mobility systems. Lu Yang, Ahmad Sufril Azlan Mohamed, Majid Khan Majahar Ali [8]
2.7.8.1 METHODOLOGY
The study integrates multiple computer vision techniques to improve near-miss detection:
Instance Segmentation Head
Enhances bounding box detection accuracy, especially for small targets (motorcycles, bicycles).
Fuses segmentation with detection to increase precision.
Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM)
Applied to all detection outputs.
Converts camera views into a top-down perspective to better estimate distances between objects.
Near-Miss Assessment
Relationships between detected objects analyzed based on proximity and speed.
Identifies potential collision scenarios.
Trajectory Prediction with Kalman Filter
Predicts object movements a few seconds ahead.
Determines whether a near-miss is likely to occur.
Dataset and Experiments
Conducted on CCTV traffic datasets representing real-world traffic scenarios.
Evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using mean Average Precision (mAP).
2.7.8.2 RESULTS AND FINDINGS
The proposed method achieved 0.94 mAP, outperforming several benchmark models.
The instance segmentation + object detection fusion significantly improved detection of small targets like motorcycles and bicycles.
Near-miss detection accuracy was higher due to combining IPM for spatial relationships with trajectory prediction.
Kalman filter provided reliable short-term trajectory forecasts, enabling early hazard identification.
2.7.8.3 CONCLUSION
This research demonstrates that combining instance segmentation, IPM, and trajectory prediction provides a powerful framework for near-miss analysis in traffic surveillance. Key contributions include:
More accurate detection of small road users, a critical gap in current systems.
Integration of motion dynamics (speed + distance) for near-miss judgment.
Reliable short-term prediction of potential traffic conflicts.
The approach aligns with Vision Zeroâ€™s proactive safety goals, offering a data-driven method to prevent accidents before they occur.
Future Directions:
Expansion to multi-camera systems for citywide monitoring.
Integration with real-time traffic management platforms.
Further optimization for real-time deployment on roadside edge devices.
Critical Commentary and Relevance
This study is highly relevant to traffic violation detection projects, as it shifts the focus from post-incident analysis to proactive near-miss prevention. By addressing the limitations of small-target detection, it ensures that vulnerable road users (motorcyclists, cyclists, pedestrians) are not overlooked in surveillance systems.
For your project, this paper emphasizes the importance of integrating detection with predictive modeling, suggesting that CCTV-based violation detection should not only capture violations but also forecast dangerous trajectories. This predictive layer could form a major innovation in your system design.

2.8 CONCLUSION
From the reviewed literature, it is evident that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision technologies have significantly advanced traffic violation detection and monitoring systems. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and CNN-based classifiers in real-time vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and violation identification. The integration of AI with CCTV and sensor data has enhanced automation, accuracy, and enforcement efficiency while reducing human error and operational costs. Furthermore, research incorporating adaptive traffic control, drone-based monitoring, and predictive analytics has expanded the scope of intelligent transportation systems globally.
However, despite these advancements, several gaps remain. Current systems still face challenges with accuracy in congested environments, limited violation categories, and environmental sensitivity under low lighting or adverse weather conditions. High computational demands and deployment costs further restrict large-scale adoption, particularly in low-resource regions. Additionally, while most studies focus on detection, there is limited exploration of real-time multi-violation handling and integrated data management for automated reporting and enforcement.
This project seeks to address these gaps by developing an AI-based traffic violation detection system that integrates deep learning models with CCTV infrastructure for real-time, multi-violation recognition. The proposed system will leverage lightweight, high-performance models for efficient detection under varying environmental conditions and will include a data management framework for storing, analyzing, and reporting violations automatically. By focusing on scalability, affordability, and real-world adaptability, this study aims to contribute a practical, context-aware solution to enhance road safety and law enforcement efficiency.

CHAPTER 3
SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
3.1  Overview
This chapter details the system analysis and design portion as well as the methodology of the project. The system to be built will be described in this chapter along with models that will be used in the design and implementation of  the AI-based traffic violation detection system.  The various design and development tools that will be adopted are also outlined as well as the requirements for software.
3.2  Requirement Analysis
During the development, a requirement analysis was needed to determine the type of  AI-based traffic violation detection system that will meet the standard needs. Our analysis was based on online research, in helping to create a system that reduces the dependency on manual traffic monitoring and improves road safety and law enforcement efficiency by identifying violations such as over-speeding, red-light running, lane discipline breaches, and unauthorized parking. Other goals include:
To design and implement an AI-based system capable of analyzing live or recorded CCTV footage to detect traffic violations automatically.
To provide accurate and real-time violation reports to traffic authorities.
To maintain a database of detected violations for future reference and analytics.
The AI-based traffic violation detection system has three main components:
Video/Image Acquisition Module: This includes hardware such as cameras or sensors used for capturing images or videos of traffic scenes, which form the primary input for subsequent analysis.
AI-Based Violation Detection and Processing Unit: This core component utilizes algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), object detection models (e.g., YOLO), and image pre-processing techniques to analyze the captured footage, identify violations, and extract relevant details such as vehicle numbers.
Reporting and Alerting System: This unit automates the creation of violation reports with evidence (images, timestamps, locations) and issues notifications or penalties to violators through centralized dashboards or integration with law enforcement systems.
3.2.1  Functional Requirements
Vehicle Detection: The system should detect moving vehicles from CCTV video feeds using object detection algorithms (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN).
License Plate Recognition (ALPR/ANPR): Extract and recognize vehicle license plates for identification and reporting. This ensures that every detected violation can be linked to a specific vehicle.
Violation Detection: Identify violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, lane crossing, and illegal turns. 
Speed Estimation: Measure vehicle speed using video frame analysis and detect overspeeding cases. If a vehicle exceeds the legal limit, the system flags it as a speed violation.
Integration with Existing CCTV Systems: Allow integration with city surveillance cameras without major hardware modification. This makes deployment cost-effective and scalable.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports on types of violations, frequency, and locations for data-driven decision-making.
Alert/Notification System: Send real-time alerts to traffic authorities for each detected violation.
Data Storage and Management: Store violation data (video, image, vehicle details, date, time, location) in a secure database.
User Interface (Dashboard): Provide an interactive web interface for authorities to review and manage violations.
3.2.1  Non Functional Requirements
Performance: The system should process and detect violations in real-time or near real-time. This ensures timely alerts to traffic authorities and prevents backlogs of unprocessed footage.
Accuracy: Detection accuracy should exceed 90% under optimal conditions. The AI models used for vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and violation classification must achieve high precision (â‰¥90%) under good conditions. False positives (wrongly flagged violations) and false negatives (missed violations) should be minimized.
Scalability: The system should support multiple CCTV inputs simultaneously. The system must handle an increasing number of CCTV feeds without performance degradation. As cities expand their surveillance networks, the architecture should support easy addition of new cameras and servers.
Reliability: System uptime should be above 99% to ensure continuous operation. The system should be operational at least 99% of the time. Fault tolerance and backup mechanisms should be included to maintain continuous operation even if some components fail.
Compatibility: Should work with different CCTV camera models and resolutions. The software should work with different CCTV camera brands and resolutions, as well as across operating systems (Windows/Linux). This makes it flexible for deployment in various environments.
Maintainability: The system should be designed so that AI models can be retrained with new data, and software updates or bug fixes can be applied without major downtime.
