# Task: Run Test Suite & Identify Failures

**Session ID:** orch-20260205-traffic-ai
**Source:** Orchestrator
**Context:** Project has 38 tests - need to verify current pass rate and identify failures
**Priority:** P1
**Dependencies:** 01_verify_setup.task.md
**Created At:** 2026-02-05 22:52

## 📋 Objective

Run the complete test suite and document which tests pass/fail. Prioritize fixing critical failures.

## 🎯 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Run `pytest` with verbose output
- Document all passing/failing tests
- Identify root cause of failures
- Fix simple/obvious test failures
- Report test coverage percentage

**Out of Scope:**
- Adding new tests (separate task)
- Major refactoring

---

## 📚 Context

### Test Files
Located in `tests/`:
- `test_routes.py` - Flask route tests (4 tests)
- `test_detector.py` - YOLO detector tests (7 tests)
- `test_violations.py` - Violation logic tests (15 tests)
- `test_anpr.py` - ANPR/OCR tests
- `test_e2e_real_video.py` - End-to-end video processing

### Previous Test Results
From docs:
- **Total Tests:** 38
- **Passing:** 26/38 (68% pass rate)
- **Target:** ≥70% pass rate

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Full test suite runs without crashes
- [ ] Test results documented (pass/fail counts)
- [ ] Root causes of failures identified
- [ ] Simple fixes applied for obvious issues
- [ ] Test coverage report generated

## 📁 Expected Artifacts

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `02_run_tests.result.md` | Test results summary |

## 🚫 Constraints

- Run tests from project root with virtual environment activated
- Do NOT skip tests without documenting why
- Signal completion using result file

---

## 🔧 Verification Commands

```powershell
# Run all tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_routes.py -v
```
